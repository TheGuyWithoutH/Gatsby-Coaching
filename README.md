# Coaching Website

I made this site for my first year student group I was coaching to welcome then and make them discover each other. They were asked to fill a form to tell a bit about themselves. 

This website was made in React.js, with the help of GatsbyJS, a framework that allows multipages React applications and fast development build deployements. Check out [there](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
